# summary

i tried to use rootless docker

rootless docker does not allow user mapping between host and container

# completely different approach

i have reverted to using podman

i had concerns with podman and debian

so, I am experimenting with using fedora

podman is already installed in fedora

I followed the following guidance

https://sureshjoshi.com/development/fedora-raspberry-pi

In simple terms, I downloaded the Fedora For ARMÂ® aarch64 systems
from
https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download

Then used Pi Imager to make the image

using the Custom option and then selecting the downloaded file
