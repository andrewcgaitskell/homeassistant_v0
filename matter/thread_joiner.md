start again, the Docker image has the idf and is working - I just need the docker run commands to create the joiner project and then how to flash it to the esp32c6

Here's how you can use the Docker image to create, build, and flash a Thread Joiner project for the ESP32-C6:
Step 1: Create the Joiner Project

Run this Docker command to copy the Thread Joiner example into your working directory:

docker run --rm -v /home/pi5ha/thread_joiner_project:/project -w /opt/esp/idf/examples/openthread espressif/idf \
    cp -r joiner /project

This copies the example project into /home/pi5ha/my_project.
Step 2: Configure the Project

Launch the container to configure the project using idf.py menuconfig:

docker run --rm -it -v /home/pi5ha/my_project:/project -w /project espressif/idf \
    idf.py menuconfig

In the menu:

    Navigate to: Component Config â†’ OpenThread.
    Enable Thread Joiner Role.
    Set the Joiner PSKd to match the OTBR commissioner (e.g., J01NME).
    Adjust other settings as needed (e.g., GPIOs or Thread parameters).
    Save and exit.

Step 3: Build the Project

Run the following command to build the firmware:

docker run --rm -v /home/pi5ha/my_project:/project -w /project espressif/idf \
    idf.py build

Step 4: Flash the Firmware to the ESP32-C6

    Find the Serial Port: Plug in your ESP32-C6 and determine its serial port (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0):

ls /dev/ttyUSB*

Flash the Firmware: Run this command to flash the firmware to the ESP32-C6:

docker run --rm -it --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -v /home/pi5ha/my_project:/project -w /project espressif/idf \
    idf.py flash

Replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with the actual serial port.

Monitor the Logs: Use this command to monitor the ESP32-C6 logs after flashing:

    docker run --rm -it --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -v /home/pi5ha/my_project:/project -w /project espressif/idf \
        idf.py monitor

Step 5: Commission the Joiner on the OTBR

    Start Commissioner: On your OTBR device (e.g., Raspberry Pi), start the commissioner:

sudo ot-ctl
> commissioner start

Add Joiner: Add the ESP32-C6 to the Thread network:

> commissioner joiner add J01NME <eui64>

Replace <eui64> with the ESP32-C6's EUI-64 address, which is printed in the logs when you run the monitor command.
